Note: To run the algorithms, you must put your puzzle inputs it in each ```dayxx``` directory accordingly, since the AoC creator prefers that puzzle inputs don't be shared. You can get them [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022). You can run all of them at once by executing the bash script ```run_all.sh```.
